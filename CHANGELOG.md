# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, not that anyone will read it.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-03-20

### Added

- Initial release of Autoji, another tool in the infinite sea of browser extensions
- AI-powered emoji suggestions that probably won't understand your true feelings
- Right-click menu integration for those too lazy to copy-paste
- Keyboard shortcuts for the keyboard warriors
- Beautiful UI that will be outdated in 6 months
- Privacy-focused implementation because we're too lazy to collect data

### Changed

- Nothing, this is the first release. The void remains undisturbed.

### Security

- Minimal permissions required (we promise we're not evil)
- Local processing of text selections
- No data collection or tracking (we don't care what emojis you use)

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features

- More AI models to misinterpret your emotions
- Additional keyboard shortcuts nobody will remember
- Dark mode, because apparently that's mandatory now
- Better error messages to express your computer's disappointment

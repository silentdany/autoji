# Autoji Privacy Policy

*Last updated: March 20, 2024*

## The Short Version (TL;DR)

We collect nothing. Your data stays on your device. Your API key is yours. That's it. You can stop reading now.

## The Long Version (For Those Who Actually Care)

### 1. Information Collection

We collect absolutely nothing, because:

- We're too lazy to set up a database
- Your data is your business
- Privacy is actually important

### 2. OpenAI API Key

- Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in your browser's storage
- We never see it
- We never transmit it anywhere except directly to OpenAI's API
- If you lose it, we can't help you (we don't have it, remember?)

### 3. Text Processing

- When you select text and request an emoji suggestion:
  - The selected text is sent DIRECTLY to OpenAI using YOUR API key
  - This happens through our Vercel serverless function (<https://autoji.vercel.app>)
  - We don't log it
  - We don't store it
  - We don't even remember it existed
  - It's like a digital version of short-term memory loss

### 4. Local Storage

We store exactly two things in your browser's local storage:

1. Your OpenAI API key (encrypted)
2. Your preferences (if you have any)

That's it. No cookies. No tracking. No analytics. Not even a hit counter from the 90s.

### 5. Third-Party Services

- **OpenAI API**: Your selected text and API key go there. Read [OpenAI's privacy policy](https://openai.com/privacy) if you're curious about what they do with it.
- **Vercel**: Hosts our API endpoint. They see the encrypted traffic but can't do anything with it. See [Vercel's privacy policy](https://vercel.com/privacy).

### 6. Data Retention

We retain nothing. Zero. Null. Void. It's like we have digital amnesia.

### 7. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Use the extension
- Not use the extension
- Uninstall the extension
- Wonder why you installed the extension
- All of the above

### 8. Changes to This Policy

If we change this policy, it will probably be to add more sarcastic comments about privacy in tech. But we'll let you know.

### 9. Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy:

- Create an issue on our GitHub repository
- Send a carrier pigeon
- Yell into the void

### 10. Legal Basis

We process your data based on:

- Your consent
- The fact that we literally can't process it any other way because we don't collect it

## Conclusion

This extension is about as privacy-focused as it gets, not because we're trying to win awards, but because we genuinely couldn't be bothered to set up any data collection infrastructure.

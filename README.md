# Autoji - AI Emoji Suggester ðŸ¤–âœ¨

A Chrome extension that uses AI to suggest the perfect emoji for any text. Because apparently, humans can't be trusted to choose their own emojis anymore.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Instant emoji suggestions for selected text
- ðŸ§  AI-powered recommendations
- âš¡ Quick access via right-click menu or keyboard shortcut
- ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful, minimal interface
- ðŸ”’ Privacy-focused: No data collection

## Installation

1. Download from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autoji) (Coming soon)

Or install manually:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. Question your life choices that led you to installing yet another browser extension

## Usage

1. Select any text on a webpage
2. Right-click and select "Suggest Emoji with Autoji"
3. Or use the keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows/Linux) or `âŒ˜+Shift+E` (Mac)
4. Marvel at the AI's attempt to understand human emotion
5. Click to copy the suggested emoji

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the extension
npm run build

# Run tests (if you believe in testing)
npm test
```

## Privacy

This extension requires minimal permissions:
- `contextMenus`: For the right-click menu functionality
- `storage`: To remember your preferences (if you have any)
- `clipboardWrite`: To copy emojis to clipboard

## Support

If something goes wrong (and it probably will):
- Open an issue on GitHub
- Send a carrier pigeon
- Scream into the void

## License

MIT - Because sharing is caring, even in this meaningless universe.
